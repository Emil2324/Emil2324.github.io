    <h1>
        Nat Turner
    </h1>
    <p> Nat Turner (October 2, 1800 – November 11, 1831) was an African-American slave who led a two-day rebellion of slaves
        and free blacks in Southampton County, Virginia on August 21, 1831. The rebellion caused the death of approximately
        sixty white men, women and children. Whites organized militias and called out regular troops to suppress the uprising.
        In addition, white militias and mobs attacked blacks in the area, killing an estimated 120,[2][3] many of whom were
        not involved in the revolt;[4] no one was arrested, tried or executed for these crimes. The rebels went from plantation
        to plantation, gathering horses and guns, freeing other slaves along the way, and recruiting other blacks who wanted
        to join their revolt. During the rebellion, Virginia legislators targeted free blacks with a colonization bill, which
        allocated new funding to remove them, and a police bill that denied free blacks trials by jury and made any free
        blacks convicted of a crime subject to sale and relocation.[5] In the aftermath, the state tried those accused of
        being part of Turner's slave rebellion, 18 were executed, 14 were transported out of state and several were acquitted.[6]
        Turner hid successfully for two months. When found, he was tried, convicted, sentenced to death, hanged and possibly
        beheaded.[7] Across Virginia and other southern states, state legislators passed new laws to control slaves and free
        blacks. They prohibited education of slaves and free blacks, restricted rights of assembly for free blacks, withdrew
        their right to bear arms (in some states), and to vote (in North Carolina, for instance), and required white ministers
        to be present at all black worship services.</p>
    <h2>Early years</h2>

        Born into slavery on October 2, 1800,[1] in Southampton County, Virginia, Turner was recorded as "Nat" by Benjamin Turner,
        the man who held his mother and him as slaves. When Benjamin Turner died in 1810, Nat became the property of Benjamin's
        son Samuel Turner.[5] For most of his life he was known as "Nat", but after the 1831 rebellion, he was widely referred
        to as "Nat Turner".[8] Turner knew little about the background of his father, who was believed to have escaped from
        slavery when Turner was a young boy.[9] Turner spent his entire life in Southampton County, a plantation area where
        slaves comprised the majority of the population.[10] He was identified as having "natural intelligence and quickness
        of apprehension, surpassed by few."[11] He learned to read and write at a young age. Deeply religious, Nat was often
        seen fasting, praying, or immersed in reading the stories of the Bible.[12] Turner's religious convictions manifested
        as frequent visions which he interpreted as messages from God. His belief in the visions was such that when Turner
        was 22 years old, he ran away from his owner; he returned a month later after claiming to have received a spiritual
        revelation. Turner often conducted Baptist services, preaching the Bible to his fellow slaves, who dubbed him "The
        Prophet". Turner garnered white followers such as Etheldred T. Brantley, whom Turner was credited with having convinced
        to "cease from his wickedness".[13] In early 1828, Turner was convinced that he "was ordained for some great purpose
        in the hands of the Almighty."[14] While working in his owner's fields on May 12, Turner heard a loud noise in the
        heavens, and the Spirit instantly appeared to me and said the Serpent was loosened, and Christ had laid down the
        yoke he had borne for the sins of men, and that I should take it on and fight against the Serpent, for the time was
        fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first.[15] Joseph Dreis wrote: "In connecting
        this vision to the motivation for his rebellion, Turner makes it clear that he sees himself as participating in the
        confrontation between God's Kingdom and the anti-Kingdom that characterized his social-historical context."[16] He
        was convinced that God had given him the task of "slay[ing] my enemies with their own weapons."[15] Turner said:
        "I communicated the great work laid out for me to do, to four in whom I had the greatest confidence" – his fellow
        slaves Henry, Hark, Nelson, and Sam.[15] Beginning in February 1831, Turner claimed certain atmospheric conditions
        as a sign to begin preparations for a rebellion against slaveowners. On February 12, 1831, an annular solar eclipse
        was visible in Virginia. Turner envisioned this as a black man's hand reaching over the sun.[17] He initially planned
        the rebellion to begin on July 4, Independence Day. Turner postponed it because of illness and to use the delay for
        additional planning with his co-conspirators. On August 7 there was another solar eclipse in which the sun appeared
        bluish-green, possibly the result of lingering atmospheric debris from an eruption of Mount St. Helens in present-day
        Washington state. Turner interpreted this as the final signal, and about a week later, on August 21, he began the
        uprising.[18]

        Rebellion

        Turner started with a few trusted fellow slaves. "All his initial recruits were other slaves from his neighborhood".[19]
        The neighborhood men had to find ways to communicate their intentions without giving up their plot. Songs may have
        tipped the neighborhood members on movements. "It is believed that one of the ways Turner summoned fellow conspirators
        to the woods was through the use of particular songs."[20] The rebels traveled from house to house, freeing slaves
        and killing the white people they found. The rebels ultimately included more than 70 enslaved and free men of color.[21]
        Because the rebels did not want to alert anyone to their presence as they carried out their attacks, they initially
        used knives, hatchets, axes, and blunt instruments instead of firearms.[22] The rebellion did not discriminate by
        age or sex, and members killed white men, women, and children.[23] Nat Turner confessed to killing only one person,
        Margaret Whitehead, whom he killed with a blow from a fence post.[22] Before a white militia could organize and respond,
        the rebels killed 60 men, women, and children.[24] They spared a few homes "because Turner believed the poor white
        inhabitants 'thought no better of themselves than they did of negros.'"[24][25] Turner also thought that revolutionary
        violence would serve to awaken the attitudes of whites to the reality of the inherent brutality in slave-holding.
        Turner later said that he wanted to spread "terror and alarm" among whites.[26]
